"Therefore, submit to God. But resist the Devil, and he will flee from you." (James 4:7 HCSB)

Let's be honest and take down the facade for just a few moments today...some days are hard! There are days that I don't feel like putting my best foot forward and days I wonder why God called me in to ministry. There are days I sincerely question if I am accurately reflecting the peace, love, grace and joy of Christ within me. I often feel as though for many followers of Christ we tend to run our "me and Jesus" relationship at about a 60/40 ratio, with the majority being a self-centered, convenient form of what we justify as the Christian life.I would say, for many, that on a good day we run about 90/10, which in theory sounds good right? I mean, that 90%, that's passing...that's an A! 

Here's the thing, I don't recall reading anywhere in scripture that we are called to submit part of our life to Christ. Christ didn't give bits and pieces of Himself for us when it was convenient for Him. Christ fully submitted all of Himself to the Father so that we may walk in freedom and be covered by His grace. Just as Christ was called to be all in, we are called to be all in, one-hundred percent, one-hundred percent of the time. Living a life for Christ isn't a 50/50 relationship that involves mutual submission. Living for Christ is submitting all of you for all of Him. It's giving up complete control; our thoughts, our actions and our words and allowing the Spirit of God to reflect out of our hearts to the atmosphere and people around us. Stay strong and keep moving! God has a purpose for you, for your life and he wants to use you now. Don't get caught up in rules and regulations, religion and legalism. You don't have to know it all or have experienced it all, but you must be willing to submit 100% to God and His will. Keep fighting, keep pressing on and don't quit!
